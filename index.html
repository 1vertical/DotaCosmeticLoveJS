                <p>
                    Greetings folks! I'm back. I've made a new <em>"analysis"</em> of Dota 2's wardrobe. What has changed since the last... *checks publish date of last analysis* ...6 years?! What. Anyway, without further
                    wasting time. Here ya go! :)
                </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Table Design Changes</h2>

            <h3>Added</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Added new columns.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Changed</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reordered columns to make comparisons easier.</li>
                <li>Data source changed from gamepedia.com to fandom.com (former URL reroutes to the fandom.com URL).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Removed</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"Broken down?" column is removed. All heroes are currently released. For the uninitiated, this column tracked which heroes were ready/partially ready/not ready for getting new equipment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Golden number means this hero has a(n) item(s) with duplicates that has gold textures.</li>
                <li>Add more items after the time of publishing for a realistic count of items - I count by hand and don't web crawl the source site and it is possible that items were added after I was done counting.</li>
                <li>Sets doesn't necessarily include items made for all slots. Examples: Single items, Arcanas, early lifetime sets - typically a set with 3 items instead of an item for all slots, etc.</li>
                <li>Each hero has their own amount of slots - this can inflate/deflate the ratio. This means it can affect the actual total number of items per hero.</li>
                <li></li>
                <li>There is no "Workshop Sets (Past)" column because I didn't record it back in the day.</li>
                <li>
                    Column explanations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hero - The hero in question.</li>
                        <li>Slots - The total amount of slots for the character. Note: this may have been changed and will be indicated in parenthesis.</li>
                        <li>Has Arcana - The hero has an arcana item or not.</li>
                        <li>Has Persona - The hero has a personal item or not.</li>
                        <li>Workshop Sets (Present) - The current total sets that is on the workshop. Note: This is an unreliable number as there are sets with items that are: not items (junk) and items that don't fit with the aesthetic of the game.</li>
                        <li>Published Sets (Past) - The last recorded total of published sets.</li>
                        <li>Published Sets (Present) - The current recorded total of published sets.</li>
                        <li>Published Sets (Difference)  - The total difference between old and new published sets.</li>
                        <li>Total Love (Past) - The last recorded total of published items.</li>
                        <li>Total Love (Present) - The current recorded total of published items.</li>
                        <li>Total Love (Difference) - The total difference between old and new published items.</li>
                        <li>Notes - Notes about the particular hero's items, trends, general information regarding design, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        Tiny takes a crap ton of time to make sets for. Creatives essentially create 4 heroes (levels of growth) for a single hero. To make it fair, you can take all the numbers here and multiply it by 4
                        to get a fair'ish result.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Around 6 years ago, the game was still shaping up, and boy, did it! Previously, the art style was defined and creatives needed to adhere the design documents. It is interesting to see how the overall art style has 
        changed over the years. 
        
        Thanks for viewing, another update after 6 years! Maybe!
